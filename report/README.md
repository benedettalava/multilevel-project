This study examines the relationship between freedom of expression and the rule of law, measured by ex-
ecutive respect for the constitution, across 20 European countries from 1960 to 2010. Using panel data
from the V-Dem dataset, the Penn World Table, and supplementary sources, I employed multilevel model-
ing techniques, including fixed effects, random effects, within-between, and Mundlak models, to disentangle
within-country temporal effects from cross-country differences. My findings reveal a robust positive associ-
ation between constitutional respect and freedom of expression, with within-country improvements in the
rule of law showing stronger effects than between-country disparities. Notably, corruption levels and regime
type further moderate this relationship. The analysis underscores the importance of institutional checks on
executive power in safeguarding expressive freedoms. Methodologically, the study demonstrates the advan-
tages of within-between decomposition over conventional panel models in isolating temporal dynamics from
structural differences.
