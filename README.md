# Freedom of Expression and Rule of Law in Europe (1960‚Äì2010)

This project investigates the relationship between freedom of expression and the rule of law‚Äîmeasured by executive respect for the constitution‚Äîacross 20 European countries over the period 1960‚Äì2010.

## üìä Project Overview

Using panel data from the **V-Dem dataset**, the **Penn World Table**, and additional sources, the analysis applies **multilevel modeling techniques** to distinguish between **within-country temporal changes** and **between-country structural differences**.

The models employed include:

- Fixed effects
- Random effects
- Within-between (WB) models
- Mundlak models

Key findings:

- There is a **strong positive association** between executive constitutional respect and freedom of expression.
- **Within-country improvements** in the rule of law have stronger effects than between-country differences.
- **Corruption** and **regime type** moderate this relationship.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Why It Matters

The study highlights the critical role of institutional checks on executive power in safeguarding expressive freedoms, particularly in democratic contexts. Methodologically, it demonstrates the **advantages of within-between decomposition** over traditional panel data approaches.
